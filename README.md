You are tasked with updating the credit limits for customers who have shipped orders of $1,000 or more. Customers meeting this criteria should have their credit limit increased by 10% of their total order amount, rounded to the nearest whole number. However, customers whose new credit limit exceeds $50,000 should have their credit limit capped at $50,000. Write an SQL query to accomplish this task. Ensure that you consider rounding to the nearest whole number for the credit limit adjustment.
You are tasked with applying a discount to the prices of products in certain product lines. Write an SQL query to update the prices of all products in the "Motorcycles" and "Ships" product lines.
